# Personal webpage based on [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

This is my academic webpage closely linked to my github website. Here you will find all the information related to my research career, including a short bio, my publications and how to contact me. I might add some more sections if needed.

Since I used a template downloaded from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), I've decided to leave the most important information here.


<sub><sup>[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template features various content sections and a Google Maps section with a custom map marker.
